    <p>This is a sample &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paragraph.</p>

    <pre>
            These roads will take you into your own country.
            Seasons and maps coming where this road comes
            into a landscape mirrored in these men.
            
                        Past all your influences, your home river,
                        constellations of cities, mottoes of childhood,
                        parents and easy cures, war, all evasion's wishes.
            
            What one word must never be said?
            Dead, and these men fight off our dying,
            cough in the theatres of the war.
            
                        What two things shall never be seen?
                        They : what we did.     Enemy : what we mean.
                        This is a nation's scene and halfway house.
            
            What three things can never be done?
            Forget.     Keep silent.     Stand alone.
            The hills of glass, the fatal brilliant plain.
